                    <p>We can't dig a hole to the center of the Earth. In fact, we've only ever drilled a few kilometers down—just a tiny scratch on the surface. So how do we know anything about what's happening thousands of kilometers below our feet?</p>

                    <p>This is one of the big questions in geophysics, the science that studies the physical properties of the Earth. And one of the cleverest ways we explore the deep Earth is through a method called <strong>seismic tomography</strong>. It's kind of like taking an X-ray or a CT scan of the planet, using waves from earthquakes instead of light or radiation.</p>

                    <p><strong>But there's a problem:</strong> we can only measure what happens at the surface. We record how fast earthquake waves arrive, how they travel, and how they change. But we can't see directly what's inside. So scientists work backwards from the measurements to figure out what the inside of the Earth must be like.</p>

                    <p>To do that, we use two powerful ideas: <strong>inversion</strong> and <strong>inference</strong>. They sound similar, but they are actually quite different.</p>

                    <p><strong>Inversion</strong> is like trying to solve a mystery by building a complete picture of what happened. Scientists use the data from the surface to guess what kind of internal structure would cause waves to behave the way they do. The goal is to find one possible model of the Earth’s interior that fits all the measurements and assumptions we have. Of course, there may be more than one model that works—so inversions often need us to make subjective choices to get to a final, unique, picture.</p>

                    <p><strong>Inference</strong>, on the other hand, doesn’t try to build the whole picture. Instead, it focuses on answering a specific question. For example: “What’s the average temperature under this region?” or “How deep is this particular boundary?” Even if we can't tell exactly what's inside, we might still be able to say something useful about one key property. This is what inference does—it looks for reliable answers to specific questions, even when the full story remains uncertain.</p>

                    <p>To put it simply: <em>inversion tries to reconstruct the full puzzle; inference tries to answer a question without needing every piece</em>.</p>

                    <p>Both of these methods are essential for exploring our planet. They help us learn about how Earth works—from the movement of continents, to where earthquakes happen, to how heat flows through the deep interior. Even though we can't go there ourselves, we can still learn a lot by listening carefully to what the Earth tells us.</p>
